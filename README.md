Rules
-----

If you haven't seen any Cyberpunk gameplays and haven't played yourself, I'll tell you the rules.

At the beggining, the selection line will be on 1 line. You should input number from 1 to 5 to choose which column will be in use. After that you should input number from 1 to 5 to choose which line will be in use.

You should choose such sequences that all values match the origin sequence. If you are wrong, you have to try again.

Pleasant use :)
